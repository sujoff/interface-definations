# Interface Definitions Repository

Welcome to the **Interface Definitions Repository**! This repository is to help us define and manage internal and external system interfaces.

## Repository Structure

This repo is organized into the following key sections:

- **`templates/`**: Provides reusable templates for interface definitions.
- **`interfaces/`**: Stores the actual interface definitions, categorized by internal and external systems.
- **`code-snippets/`**: Offers example code snippets demonstrating how to use the defined interfaces.
- **`docs/`**: Contains all the documentation to help onboard new contributors and maintainers, including guidelines and best practices.
- **`tools/`**: Houses automation tools like the Git Analyzer Bot, which tracks interface changes and updates records in VEAR.

## How to Contribute

To add a new interface:

1. Copy the template from the **`templates/`** directory.
2. Modify it according to your service's needs and place it in the appropriate folder under **`interfaces/`**.
3. Update the relevant documentation, if necessary.
4. Submit a pull request for review.

## Automation

We use a **Git Analyzer Bot** to automatically track interface changes and keep our records up-to-date in **VEAR**. This bot scans for updates and validates interface definitions.
